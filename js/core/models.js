 * 별 데이터, 별자리선, 별자리명을 통합 관리하는 모듈입니다.
 *
 * 포함된 데이터:
 * - STARS_DATA: 5000+ 별의 정보 (CSV 형식)
 * - CONSTELLATION_LINES: 별자리선 좌표
 * - CONSTELLATION_NAMES: 별자리 이름과 표시 위치
 */

/**
 * 별 데이터 (CSV 형식)
 *
 * 6등급 이하의 밝은 별 약 5000개의 정보를 담고 있습니다.
 *
 * CSV 컬럼 형식:
 * 1. 바이어/플램스티드 명칭 (예: "21Alp And", "85 Peg")
 * 2. 고유 이름 (예: "Alpheratz", "Vega") - 없으면 빈 값
 * 3. 적경 RA (시간 단위, 0-24)
 * 4. 적위 Dec (도 단위, -90 ~ +90)
 * 5. 겉보기 등급 (1-6, 숫자가 작을수록 밝음)
 * 6. 분광형 (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)
 *
 * @constant {string}
 * @example
 * // 데이터 파싱 예시
 * const lines = STARS_DATA.trim().split('\n');
 * const stars = lines.map(line => {
 *     const [name, propername, ra, dec, mag, spectral] = line.split(',');
 *     return { name, propername, ra: parseFloat(ra), dec: parseFloat(dec),
 *              mag: parseInt(mag), spectral };
 * });
